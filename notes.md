# Ideas for mechanics
- Puzzle mode. Pieces don't drop automatically, only when you press down. Levels can start with a filled grid, a known set of pieces, and a goal (clear grid in at most X moves, get score at least X, clear grid only clearing 3 lines at a time, etc)
- Ticking timebomb mode. Placed pieces get a lifetime which ticks down one point each time the automatic piece drop happens. You lose if a piece hits 0 and explodes.
- Colour clear mode. Pieces are made up of coloured cells, possibly multiple colour per piece. Instead of clearing full lines, you clear regions of 5+ cells of the same colour touching. You get more points for clearing larger regions.
