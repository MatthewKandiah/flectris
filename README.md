# Flectris
Tetris but you can pick your tileset.

## Plan
- draw a menu with a button in it, when you click the button we open "the game", when you press escape it reopens the menu

## Short term plan
- should drawables be in units of actual pixels instead of [-1, +1] screen coordinates so we can draw actually square squares? Should we invert the y-axis so it's [0, 1] increasing from bottom to top to make it simpler to reason about as well?
