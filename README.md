# Flectris
Tetris but you can pick your tileset.

## Plan - Medium Term
- add texture image and sampling
- enable blending (so we can have transparent bits on our sprites)

## Plan - Short Term
- create image view, create combined image sampler, bind it to the graphics pipeline, use it in our fragment shader
