# Flectris
Tetris but you can pick your tileset.

## Plan
- Write tetris / tetris block designer

## Short term plan
- levels - speed up after number of lines cleared
- game page layout & show next & show score
- one button drop (press up to slam a piece)
- make prettier => instead of cells being filled/unfilled, we want to be able to use different textures for them

- refactor entity click handling to reduce copy-pasting
- some tidying:
  - do we need to reorganise files?
  - do we want helper functions around our events and game state?
