# Flectris
Tetris but you can pick your tileset.

## Plan
- Write tetris / tetris block designer

## Short term plan
- limit frame rate to 60 fps
- draw "tetris grid"
- draw "active piece"
- update active piece position
- add line clears
- add non-clickable text entity (for score / decoration)
- refactor entity click handling to reduce copy-pasting
- some tidying:
  - do we need to reorganise files?
  - do we want helper functions around our events and game state?
