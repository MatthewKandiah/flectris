# Flectris
Tetris but you can pick your tileset.

## Plan
- Nicer laid out menu
- Write tetris / tetris block designer

## Short term plan
- some tidying:
  - do we need to reorganise files?
  - do we want to tidy our input handling to make it easier to extend?
  - do we want helper functions around our events and game state?
  - do we want to refactor our run script to output a debug build binary and put all our outputs into a build directory?
